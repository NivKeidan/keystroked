# when migrating

Blog page design:
- make the top wider, simialar to webdesignerdepot
- consider keeping the header
- consider doing text on white background, same as webdesignerdepot
- add images to post, see how they look
- move the sahre buttons to the top
- check mobile

Tidy up:
- Toaster is no longer used, instead we arew using shadcn sonner component. usage in shadcn docs is:
`import { toast } from "sonner"`
- fix icons deprecated
- go over all componenets, make sure they are rendered properly

Whos behind this:
- design and finalize the whos behind this button
- github link
- linkedin link
- contact possibility

- rework the ascii images per article. find the common prompt and instructions to do this.

Small tasks:
- add a notice about content not being AI generated
- link copied is not a modal or toast but an annoying big msg. fix it.
- check all share buttons. i don't think any of them work.
- revise the header, name and short sentences under the header
- add icon to the website page (instead of the Astro A)
- keep code but hide newsletter part
- remove the Lovable project locally
- publish online on my domain
- get design feedbacks
- remove footer rss feed, github and twitter icons
- rewmove the made with lovable and caffine
- find new name
- remove the echo builindg in public
- write the first blog post
