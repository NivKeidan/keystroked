# when migrating

- option/idea: have same theme or idea for ascii art, but one small and one big. they can be different, that can be actually nice. and this will be more like art and I can write an article on how art is still slow even with AI.

- rework the ascii images per article. find the common prompt and instructions to do this.

Small tasks:
- add a notice about content not being AI generated
- remove the viewall link in the ~/rwecent separator
- extract the sharing buttons in each blog post to their own component
- link copied is not a modal or toast but an annoying big msg. fix it.
- check all share buttons. i don't think any of them work.
- revise the header, name and short sentences under the header
- add icon to the website page (instead of the Astro A)
- keep code but hide newsletter part
- remove the Lovable project locally
- publish online on my domain
- get design feedbacks
- remove footer rss feed, github and twitter icons
- rewmove the made with lovable and caffine
- find new name
- remove the echo builindg in public
- write the first blog post
- implement the newsletter feature
