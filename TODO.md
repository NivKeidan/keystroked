# Small tasks

- ask michal about the "keystroked, not generated"
- add icon to the website page (instead of the Astro A)
- write the first blog post
- rework the ascii images per article
- publish online on my domain
- implement the newsletter feature

before publishing:

- finalize wording of whos behind this
- check all share buttons. i don't think any of them work.

nice to have:

- extract the sharing buttons in each blog post to their own component
